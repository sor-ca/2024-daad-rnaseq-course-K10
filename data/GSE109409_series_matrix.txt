!Series_summary	"Post-traumatic stress disorder is a concerning psycho behavioral disorder thought to emerge from the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. For soldiers exposed to combat, the risk of developing this disorder is two-fold and diagnosis is often late, when much sequela has set in. To be able to identify and diagnose in advance those at “risk” of developing PTSD, would greatly taper the gap between late sequelae and treatment. Therefore, this study sought to test the hypothesis that the transcriptome can be used to track the development of PTSD in this unique and susceptible cohort of individuals. Gene expression levels in peripheral blood samples from 85 Canadian infantry soldiers (n = 58 subjects negative for PTSD symptoms and n = 27 subjects with PTSD symptoms) were determined by RNA sequencing technology following their return from deployment to Afghanistan. Count-based gene expression quantification, normalization and differential analysis (with thorough correction for confounders) revealed significant differences in two genes, LRP8 and GOLM1 . These preliminary results provide a proof-of-principle for the diagnostic utility of blood-based gene expression profiles for tracking symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers returning from tour. It is also the first to report transcriptome-wide expression profiles alongside a post-traumatic symptom checklist."
